        There are two types of withdrawals:<br />
        <u>Partial Withdrawals</u> (also known as &quot;skimming&quot;) - an automatic process that happens while your validator continues to be part
        &nbsp;of the Beacon Chain, in which any amount over the principle 32 ETH staked (the rewards accrued to your validator balance on the Beacon Chain)
        &nbsp;will be sent to the validator&apos;s withdrawal address.
      </Text>

      <Text style={{marginBottom: 32}}>
        <u>Full Withdrawals</u> (also known as &quot;exit&quot; or &quot;unstaking&quot;) - an action that causes your validator to exit the network
        &nbsp;and stop being part of the Beacon Chain, in which its entire balance consisting of the 32 ETH principle and accured rewards are unlocked
        &nbsp;from the Beacon Chain and sent to the validator&apos;s withdrawal address.
      </Text>

      <Text style={{marginBottom: 32}}>
        Please note that there is a limit for both partial and full withdrawals, in the form of how many could be processed per each block.
        &nbsp;Withdrawals are processed within a queue, during which validators are required to continue performing their duties, which could
        &nbsp;result in processing delays, depending on the amount of validators in the network.
